 * SteamAPICore
 * 
 * Core Steam API initialization and lifecycle management.
 * Handles Steam client connection, interface management, and callback processing.
 * 
 * This class manages the fundamental Steam API operations:
 * - Initialization and shutdown of the Steam API
 * - Interface retrieval (UserStats, User)
 * - Status monitoring (Steam running, initialization state)
 * - Callback processing for Steam events
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const loader = new SteamLibraryLoader();
 * const apiCore = new SteamAPICore(loader);
 * 
 * const success = apiCore.init({ appId: 480 });
 * if (success) {
 *   console.log('[Steamworks] Steam API initialized!');
 *   // Use Steam features...
 *   apiCore.shutdown();
 * }
 * ```
