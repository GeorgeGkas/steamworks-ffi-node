## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`steam.overlay.onGameOverlayActivated(handler)`** — exposes `GameOverlayActivated_t` (`k_iSteamFriendsCallbacks + 31`), the only signal Steam gives that its overlay has opened or closed, so a game can pause and mute while the player is in it. Fires with `{ active, userInitiated, appId }` whether the player pressed the overlay hotkey or the game called one of the `activateGameOverlay*()` methods. Steam only raises it in a process it has injected its overlay renderer into: an Electron app after `addElectronSteamOverlay()`, not a plain Node.js console process. You can subscribe before `init()` (the callback registers once `init()` succeeds), and a handler that throws or returns a rejected promise is logged without stopping the others. The callback is registered through a new internal `SteamPushCallback` helper, which builds its koffi types at registration time so they stay valid after `shutdown()`'s `koffi.reset()`, and which can be unregistered more than once without throwing.
- **`tests/js/test-overlay-activated.js` / `tests/ts/test-overlay-activated.ts`** (`npm run test:overlay-activated:js` / `:ts`) — live check against a Steam client. It asserts only what holds whether or not any event arrives (a plain Node process never gets one), and exits non-zero on failure.
- **`tests/js/test-overlay-activated-offline.js` / `tests/ts/test-overlay-activated-offline.ts`** (`npm run test:overlay-activated:offline:js` / `:ts`) — deterministic test with no Steam client. A fake `steam_api` raises `GameOverlayActivated_t` through the vtable of the callback object the library registers, covering the struct layout, the event mapping, handler isolation (including rejected `async` handlers) and the register/unregister lifecycle.

### Documentation
- **README.md, `docs/README.md`, `docs/OVERLAY_MANAGER.md`** — overlay function count updated from 7 to 8, and `onGameOverlayActivated()` documented.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded Steam interface accessor versions breaking when the Steamworks SDK bumps an interface** (relates to #83) — `SteamLibraryLoader` called each of its 12 core interface accessors by an exact versioned export name (e.g. `SteamAPI_SteamUtils_v010`), baked in at whatever SDK release this project happened to be built against. Any interface differing from what's exported by the SDK a consumer actually has installed — forward *or* backward, since a redistributable can both add a newer symbol and eventually drop an ancient one — would throw at first use instead of resolving to whatever is actually available. Replaced the hardcoded names with reflection: `INTERFACE_ACCESSOR_PREFIXES` records only each interface's version-independent naming prefix (`SteamAPI_SteamUtils_v`, never a number), and `findNewestVersionedSymbol()` probes the *loaded library itself* for `<prefix>001` through `<prefix>100` (`MAX_PROBED_INTERFACE_VERSION`) and binds to the highest one it actually exports. 
- Verified the reflection resolves correctly against real Steamworks SDK 1.64 and 1.65 redistributables side by side: exactly 3 of the 12 interfaces actually differ between those releases (`SteamUtils` v010→v011, `SteamNetworkingSockets` v012→v013, `SteamInput` v006→v007, matching #83's report) — the other 9 stayed identical, and the resolver picked the correct version on both releases for all 12, with no version number hardcoded anywhere in the fix.

### Added
- **Microtransaction authorization support** — `MicroTxnAuthorizationResponse_t` (`k_iSteamUserCallbacks + 52`), exposed as `steam.user.onMicroTxnAuthorizationResponse(handler)` (via #84, thanks [@Celant](https://github.com/Celant)). Steam raises this callback when the player answers the in-overlay purchase dialog for a microtransaction started server-side with `ISteamMicroTxn/InitTxn`; it's the only in-process signal that the dialog was actually answered, so without it a game has no choice but to poll `QueryTxn` blind while the player is still deciding.
- **`test-sdks/` fixture folder + `npm run test:sdk-version-compat:js` / `:ts`** — a standalone check (no live Steam client required) that loads any Steamworks SDK redistributable dropped into `test-sdks/<version>/redistributable_bin/...` and reports which versioned symbol each of the 12 interfaces actually resolves to, using the exact same probing logic (`findNewestVersionedSymbol`) the library uses at runtime. Lets a new (or older) SDK release be verified before upgrading, and pinpoints exactly which interfaces changed version instead of guessing. `test-sdks/` is gitignored (same Valve redistribution restriction as `steamworks_sdk/`) aside from its `README.md`.
- **`tests/ts/test-microtxn.ts`** — TypeScript port of `tests/js/test-microtxn.js`

## [0.11.2] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- **`SteamMatchmakingManager.onGameLobbyJoinRequested(handler)` and `getConnectLobbyIdFromCommandLine()`** — handling for accepted lobby invites, which `inviteUserToLobby()` never covered (it only sends the invite). Accepting an invite splits into two cases per Valve's docs: if the invitee's game is already running, Steam fires `GameLobbyJoinRequested_t` (`k_iSteamFriendsCallbacks + 33`) — now exposed via `onGameLobbyJoinRequested()`, registered with the same `CCallbackBase` + `koffi.register` + `SteamAPI_RegisterCallback` push-callback pattern already used for `GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t` in `SteamUserManager`, since it's an unprompted callback, not a call result pollable via `SteamCallbackPoller`. If the invitee's game is **not** running, Steam instead launches it with `+connect_lobby <lobby id>` on the command line and the callback never fires for that launch — `getConnectLobbyIdFromCommandLine()` parses that out of `ISteamApps::GetLaunchCommandLine()` (already bound as `SteamAppsManager.getLaunchCommandLine()`) so both cases can route through the same `joinLobby()` call. The new push callback is unregistered during `SteamworksSDK.shutdown()`, before `SteamAPI_Shutdown()` and before the final `koffi.reset()`, matching the existing callback-cleanup ordering.

### Fixed
- **`uploadScore()` and other leaderboard callbacks returning corrupted data on macOS/Linux** (Fixes #74, via #75, thanks [@Stanko](https://github.com/Stanko)) — Steam's callback structs are compiled under `#pragma pack(push, 4)` on Linux/macOS/FreeBSD but `pack(push, 8)` on Windows (`steamclientpublic.h`, `VALVE_CALLBACK_PACK_SMALL`/`_LARGE` — done so 32-bit and 64-bit Steam clients agree on callback layout), while koffi's default struct definitions used native platform alignment (8-byte `uint64` on macOS/Linux) — silently decoding several fields from the wrong byte offset. Confirmed by hand-computing real field offsets and reproducing against a live Steam client: with the bug, `LeaderboardScoreUploaded_t` read `m_hSteamLeaderboard` from offset 8 instead of the real offset 4, cascading into every field after it (`m_nScore`, `m_bScoreChanged`, both rank fields) reading garbage — matching the original report's symptom of scores coming back as unrelated large numbers (e.g. `57746945` instead of `25000`) and `scoreChanged`/rank fields always wrong. Also affected `LeaderboardUGCSet_t.m_hSteamLeaderboard` and `LeaderboardEntry_t.m_hUGC`. Fixed by explicitly overriding the affected `uint64` members' alignment per platform (`koffi.struct()`'s `[alignment, type]` member syntax) to match Valve's real packing exactly, rather than relying on koffi's native-ABI default — this is the same class of bug as the `LobbyEnter_t` fix in v0.10.3, since koffi has no visibility into upstream `#pragma pack` directives and can only lay out whatever field list it's handed.
- **`downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers()` only encoding the Steam ID array's first element correctly** (via #75) — `koffi.encode(steamIdArray, 'uint64', value, i)` matched the `encode(ref, type, value, len)` overload, where the 4th argument is a length, not a byte offset, so every loop iteration wrote to byte offset 0 regardless of `i` — the requested-users array was never populated correctly for more than one Steam ID. Fixed by using the `encode(ref, offset, type, value)` overload with an explicit `i * koffi.sizeof('uint64')` byte offset.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- **koffi 3.x breaks macOS universal (x64 + arm64) Electron builds** — koffi 3.x ships its native binary as a separate per-platform `optionalDependency` package (`@koromix/koffi-<os>-<arch>`); `npm install` only fetches the variant matching the build machine, so a universal bundle built on a single machine silently ships a broken slice for the *other* architecture, crashing at startup under Rosetta or on native Intel hardware with `Error: Cannot find the native Koffi module; did you bundle it correctly?`. This can't be worked around via a normal dependency declaration — `npm install <foreign-arch-package> --force` succeeds once, but any later plain `npm install`/`npm ci` re-blocks it with `EBADPLATFORM`, since npm's platform gate applies on every install, not just the first. Added `scripts/fetch-universal-koffi.js`, exposed as `npx steamworks-fetch-universal-koffi`: run it once before packaging a universal build to fetch the missing darwin counterpart directly from the npm registry (bypassing npm's install-time platform filter, the same technique `esbuild`/`sharp` use for their own consumers). Opt-in and explicit by design — nothing runs automatically on install

### Documentation
- **README.md, `docs/STEAM_OVERLAY_INTEGRATION.md`** — added a "macOS universal builds" note under the Electron Packaging sections pointing at the new `npx steamworks-fetch-universal-koffi` command

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-15

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE

- **Minimum supported Node.js version raised from 18 to 22** — Node 18 reached end-of-life in April 2025 and Node 20's Maintenance LTS window is winding down; if you're on Node 18–21, upgrade before updating to this version

### Changed
- **Dependencies upgraded**: `typescript` 5.9.3 → 6.0.3, `node-gyp` 12.2.0 → 13.0.0, `koffi` 2.16.2 → 3.1.5, `@types/node` 25.3.0 → 26.0.0
  - `tsconfig.json` migrated to `module`/`moduleResolution: "node16"` — required by TypeScript 6, which turns the deprecated `moduleResolution: "node"` into a hard error; verified emitted `dist/` output is byte-identical to before
  - koffi 3.x ships no CommonJS-specific type declarations (`"type": "module"` plus a single non-conditional `types` entry), which conflicts with `node16` resolution for this project's CommonJS sources — added a local ambient type shim (`src/types/koffi/index.d.ts`, regenerate via `node scripts/generate-koffi-types-shim.js` after future koffi bumps) that re-declares koffi's real type surface without falling back to `any`
  - `node-gyp` 13 raises its own Node engine floor to `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0`; it's an `optionalDependency` used only by the `build:native` maintainer script (never triggered by consumer installs — `postinstall.js` is purely informational), so this doesn't affect published-package installs. On Node below its floor it's simply skipped and the build falls back to npm's bundled node-gyp
- **CI Node.js matrix updated** to `22.x` / `24.x` (previously `18.x` / `20.x`)

### Fixed
- **`koffi` 3.x shutdown segfault (SIGSEGV)** — `SteamUserManager.cleanup()` called `koffi.reset()` unconditionally as part of `SteamworksSDK.shutdown()`, *before* `apiCore.shutdown()` made its own (often first-ever, lazily-bound) koffi call; koffi's own docs state that using any function or type defined before `reset()` afterwards is undefined behavior and "will likely lead to a crash." Confirmed via an lldb backtrace (crash inside koffi's native call dispatcher) and an isolated repro reproducing the exact segfault with nothing but `reset()` followed by a first-time bind+call. Fix: `koffi.reset()` now runs as the final step of `SteamworksSDK.shutdown()`, strictly after every other koffi call including `apiCore.shutdown()`'s `unload()`
- **Security Vulnerabilities**
  - Committed `package-lock.json` (previously gitignored) and switched all CI installs from `npm i` to `npm ci`, so builds install from exact pinned versions + integrity hashes instead of re-resolving the dependency graph fresh on every run
  - Added an `npm audit --audit-level=high` gate to the CI lint job
  - Fixed a critical `tar` vulnerability (file smuggling / DoS bugs, pulled in transitively via `node-gyp`) that had no CI signal before this gate existed

### Documentation
- **Electron packaging guides corrected (`README.md`, `docs/STEAM_OVERLAY_INTEGRATION.md`)** — the documented `asarUnpack` (electron-builder) / `asar.unpack` (electron-forge) glob patterns only covered `steamworks-ffi-node/**`; since koffi 3.x ships its native binary as a separate sibling package (`@koromix/koffi-<platform>-<arch>`, an `optionalDependency` of `koffi`, not nested inside it), consumers following the old docs would hit `Error: Cannot find the native Koffi module; did you bundle it correctly?` at runtime. Patterns now explicitly include `node_modules/koffi/**` and `node_modules/@koromix/**`

## [0.10.4] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **`SteamOverlay` frame capture lag and stuttering** — the capture loop used a recursive `setTimeout` which added each frame's async capture time on top of the target interval, causing effective FPS to drop and jitter to accumulate; the fix switches to `setInterval` with a `captureInProgress` guard so the interval fires at a steady cadence regardless of capture duration, and overlapping captures are skipped instead of queued

### Performance
- **`SteamLibraryLoader.load()` no longer binds all ~200 FFI functions eagerly** — previously every `koffi.func()` symbol lookup ran at library load time, blocking the main thread for hundreds of milliseconds before the app window could appear; functions are now lazily bound on first call via a thin closure wrapper, so `load()` is near-instant and only the ~12 functions called during `init()` pay the binding cost at startup

## [0.10.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **`joinLobby()` reporting failure on macOS arm64 when the join succeeded** (Fixes #58) — `LobbyEnter_t.m_EChatRoomEnterResponse` was being read at byte offset 13 instead of 16, producing `0x01000000` (16777216) instead of `1` (`EChatRoomEnterResponse.Success`); with Steam SDK's `#pragma pack(4)`, `uint32` still requires 4-byte alignment, so 3 padding bytes follow the `bool` field on all platforms — the fix removes the incorrect manual parser and delegates to `koffi.decode` using the already-correct `LobbyEnter_t` struct definition
- **`steam.shutdown()` crashing on second call** — calling `shutdown()` more than once (e.g. both manually and via a window `closed` event) could invoke `SteamAPI_ISteamInput_Shutdown` and `SteamAPI_UnregisterCallback` against an already-unloaded native library; the fix marks the API as shut down atomically at the very start of the sequence via `apiCore.markShutdown()`, so any re-entrant or duplicate call returns immediately before touching any native handles

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **`getDLCDataByIndex()` always returning `appId: 0` and `available: false`** (Fixes #54) — root cause: koffi does not write back into plain JS arrays (`[0]`, `[false]`) used as output pointer arguments; the fix replaces all such out-params across `SteamAppsManager` with `koffi.alloc()` / `koffi.decode()`, matching the pattern already used in `SteamAchievementManager` for `getDLCDataByIndex`, `getDlcDownloadProgress`, `getTimedTrialStatus`, `getNumBetas`, `getBetaInfo`

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Linux overlay: focus steal breaking inputs and Shift+Tab** — resolved a regression where the Steam overlay became unresponsive to keyboard input after clicking a Chromium input element, and where `Shift+Tab` stopped opening the overlay after such a click

### Documentation
- **`INPUT_MANAGER.md` — `game_actions_<AppID>.vdf` filename clarified and`controller_config` folder note added** (relates to #52 and #53) 
- **`STEAM_OVERLAY_INTEGRATION.md` — Electron packaging section expanded** — the *electron-builder Configuration* section has been rewritten into a full *Electron Packaging* guide:
- **`README.md` — ASAR packaging guide added**

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-21

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE

- **`ISteamApps` interface updated to `v009` (Steamworks SDK 1.64)** — This release requires **Steamworks SDK 1.64 or newer**. Applications using an older SDK will crash at startup with a null pointer when accessing the Apps interface.
  - If you are pinned to SDK ≤ 1.63, do **not** upgrade to this version

### Added
- **`getBetaInfo()` now returns `lastUpdated`** — new `lastUpdated: number` field (Unix timestamp) on `BetaInfo` reflecting when the beta branch build was last updated, exposed via the new `lastUpdated` parameter added in SDK 1.64's `ISteamApps::GetBetaInfo()`

> **SDK requirement:** Update your `steamworks_sdk` folder to SDK 1.64 before using this version.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **ContentDescriptors API in `SteamWorkshopManager`** — 4 new functions for mature content labeling on Workshop items
  - **`addContentDescriptor(updateHandle, descriptor)`** — labels a Workshop item with a mature content descriptor via `SteamAPI_ISteamUGC_AddContentDescriptor`
  - **`removeContentDescriptor(updateHandle, descriptor)`** — removes a previously set content descriptor via `SteamAPI_ISteamUGC_RemoveContentDescriptor`
  - **`getQueryUGCContentDescriptors(queryHandle, index)`** — returns `EUGCContentDescriptorID[]` for a specific query result via `SteamAPI_ISteamUGC_GetQueryUGCContentDescriptors`
  - **`getUserContentDescriptorPreferences()`** — returns the current user's mature content preferences via `SteamAPI_ISteamUGC_GetUserContentDescriptorPreferences`
- **`EUGCContentDescriptorID` enum** added to `src/types/workshop.ts` and exported from the package root

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **`setItemTags()` in `SteamWorkshopManager`** (Fixes #49)
  - Sets the tags for a Workshop item being updated via `SteamAPI_ISteamUGC_SetItemTags`
  - Full documentation added to `docs/WORKSHOP_MANAGER.md`
  - Integration tests updated in both `tests/js/test-workshop.js` and `tests/ts/test-workshop.ts` with a round-trip scenario: set → replace → clear → restore

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **`getDigitalActionOrigins()` and `getAnalogActionOrigins()` in `SteamInputManager`** (Fixes #46)
  - Returns the `EInputActionOrigin[]` values currently mapped to a digital or analog action for a specific controller
  - Uses the existing `SteamAPI_ISteamInput_GetDigitalActionOrigins` / `SteamAPI_ISteamInput_GetAnalogActionOrigins` FFI bindings that were already present in `SteamLibraryLoader`
  - Results feed directly into `getGlyphPNGForActionOrigin()`, `getGlyphSVGForActionOrigin()`, and `getStringForActionOrigin()` for controller-specific button prompts

### Fixed
- **`getDigitalActionData()`, `getAnalogActionData()`, and `getMotionData()` always returning zero values on Linux / Steam Deck** (Fixes #47)
  - Root cause: The FFI bindings used a `void` return + output buffer (`void*`) pattern, which accidentally worked on Windows MSVC x64 ABI (hidden pointer lands in RCX) but silently discarded the return value on Linux SysV x86_64 ABI (small structs returned in RAX/RDX registers, no hidden pointer)
  - For `GetMotionData` (`InputMotionData_t` = 40 bytes, > 16 bytes), the broken pattern caused the C function to write 40 bytes of motion data into the `ISteamInput*` vtable pointer → memory corruption and segfault on Linux
  - Fix: Defined `InputDigitalActionData_t`, `InputAnalogActionData_t`, and `InputMotionData_t` as koffi structs; changed all three FFI bindings to use struct return types with the correct parameter count (3 params for digital/analog, 2 for motion); koffi now handles both register return (small structs) and hidden pointer (large structs) automatically and correctly on all platforms
  - Updated input tests

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Process hang after `shutdown()` on Electron 39+** (Fixes #45) - Calling `getAuthTicketForWebApi()` followed by `steam.shutdown()` no longer causes the process to hang indefinitely on Electron 39+
  - Root cause: Koffi's internal async broker (`napi_threadsafe_function`) was being released by the NAPI `InstanceData` finalizer during Node.js env teardown, at which point `CleanupHandles()` already holds the libuv mutex — causing a deadlock
  - Fix: `SteamUserManager.cleanup()` now calls `koffi.reset()` explicitly before env teardown, releasing the broker while the mutex is not yet held so the finalizer has nothing left to do

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Shutdown Process** - Improved shutdown and library unloading in Steam API for cleaner exits
- **npm Package** - Updated `.npmignore` to correctly include native overlay source files in published package

## [0.8.7] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Debug Mode with Centralized Logger** - Flexible debug logging system (Fixes #30)
  - New `SteamLogger` utility class for centralized logging control
  - New `setDebug(enabled: boolean)` method to control debug output visibility
  - Debug logs show SDK loading, initialization details, and internal operations
  - Errors and warnings always display regardless of debug mode setting
  - **Applied globally across ALL 16 managers** (531 logging calls migrated)
  - Covers: Achievements, Stats, Leaderboards, Friends, Cloud, Workshop, Input, Networking, Matchmaking, Utils, and more
  - **Flexible integration**: Any manager or custom code can use `SteamLogger`
  - Should be called BEFORE `restartAppIfNecessary()` or `init()` to see early logs
  - Exported from main package for advanced usage and custom integrations

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Custom SDK Path API Redesign** - Fixed critical initialization order issue (Fixes #31)
  - **Old API (v0.8.6):** `steam.init({ appId: 480, sdkPath: 'vendor/steamworks_sdk' })`
  - **New API (v0.8.7):** `steam.setSdkPath('vendor/steamworks_sdk')` must be called BEFORE `restartAppIfNecessary()` or `init()`
  - Removed `sdkPath` parameter from `SteamInitOptions` interface
  - Added new `setSdkPath(customSdkPath: string)` method to set SDK location before library loading
  - This ensures `restartAppIfNecessary()` can load the library from the correct location
  - Maintains backward compatibility for default SDK location (`steamworks_sdk` in project root)

### Example
```typescript
import SteamworksSDK, { SteamLogger } from 'steamworks-ffi-node';

const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();

// Enable debug mode to see detailed logs
steam.setDebug(true);

// Set custom SDK path BEFORE any Steam operations
steam.setSdkPath('vendor/steamworks_sdk');

// Check restart requirement (with debug logs)
if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
  process.exit(0);
}

// Initialize (with debug logs)
steam.init({ appId: 480 });

// Disable debug logs if desired
steam.setDebug(false);

// Use SteamLogger in your own code for consistent logging
SteamLogger.debug('[MyApp] Custom debug message');
SteamLogger.warn('[MyApp] Warning message');
SteamLogger.error('[MyApp] Error message');
```

### Benefits
- **Development**: See detailed initialization and SDK loading information
- **Production**: Disable debug logs to reduce noise in production environments
- **Troubleshooting**: Easily diagnose SDK path issues and initialization problems
- **Flexibility**: Toggle debug mode at any point during runtime
- **Integration**: Use `SteamLogger` in your own code for consistent logging
- **Scalability**: All managers and custom code can use the same logging system

### Why This Change?
According to Steamworks standards, `restartAppIfNecessary()` must be called BEFORE `init()` to ensure proper Steam authentication and overlay functionality. The previous v0.8.6 implementation passed `sdkPath` to `init()`, which meant `restartAppIfNecessary()` couldn't access custom SDK paths and would fail. The new `setSdkPath()` method allows setting the path once before any Steam operations.

### Migration Guide
```typescript
// OLD (v0.8.6) - BROKEN: restartAppIfNecessary() can't find custom SDK
if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
  process.exit(0);
}
steam.init({ appId: 480, sdkPath: 'vendor/steamworks_sdk' });

// NEW (v0.8.7) - CORRECT: setSdkPath() before any Steam operations
steam.setSdkPath('vendor/steamworks_sdk');

if (steam.restartAppIfNecessary(480)) {
  process.exit(0);
}
steam.init({ appId: 480 });
```

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with correct `setSdkPath()` usage pattern
- Updated STEAM_API_CORE.md with new API documentation
- Added comprehensive test files demonstrating proper usage
- Added migration guide for v0.8.6 users

## [0.8.6] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Custom SDK Path Support** - Flexible Steamworks SDK location configuration (Fixes #31)
  - New `sdkPath` option in `SteamInitOptions` to specify custom SDK location
  - Supports relative paths from project root (e.g., `vendor/steamworks_sdk`, `libs/sdk/steamworks`)
  - Ideal for monorepo setups, vendor directories, nested structures, and CI/CD pipelines
  - Maintains backward compatibility - defaults to `steamworks_sdk` in project root
  - Enhanced `SteamLibraryLoader` with custom path resolution

### Changed
- Enhanced `SteamAPICore.init()` to accept and log custom SDK paths
- Improved `SteamLibraryLoader.getSteamLibraryPath()` to prioritize custom paths
- Updated documentation with real-world examples for various project structures

### Documentation
- Added "Custom SDK paths" to Features section in README
- Added comprehensive Setup section with examples for:
  - Vendor folder organization (`vendor/steamworks_sdk`)
  - Nested SDK structures (`libs/sdk/steamworks`)
  - Monorepo configurations (`packages/game/steamworks_sdk`)
- Enhanced TypeScript interfaces with detailed JSDoc for `sdkPath` option

### Deprecated
- ⚠️ **v0.8.6 custom SDK path API** - The `sdkPath` parameter in `init()` was deprecated immediately and replaced in v0.8.7 due to initialization order issues

## [0.8.5] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **restartAppIfNecessary() Function** - Ensure applications are launched through Steam
  - New `SteamAPI_RestartAppIfNecessary()` binding for production deployment
  - Returns `true` if app needs to restart through Steam client
  - Returns `false` if app is already launched correctly (or in dev mode)
  - Call before `init()` to ensure proper Steam authentication and overlay
  - Comprehensive documentation with Node.js, TypeScript, and Electron examples
  - Test files: `test-restart-app.ts` and `test-restart-app.js`

## [0.8.4] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- Fix issue with `GetAuthTicketForWebApi()` callback on Windows

## [0.8.3] - 2026-01-03

### Changed
- **Native GetAuthTicketForWebApi Implementation** - Replaced workaround with proper callback-based implementation
  - Now uses native `GetAuthTicketForWebApi()` with registered callbacks via Koffi
  - Returns proper Web API ticket format (234 bytes) that validates correctly with Steam Web API
  - Automatic callback registration on first use and cleanup during shutdown
  - Tickets validate successfully with `ISteamUserAuth/AuthenticateUserTicket/v1` endpoint
- Enhanced test coverage for Web API ticket validation
  - Added API key prompt in test files for easy validation testing

- Proper callback cleanup during Steam API shutdown
- Memory management for callback registration and vtable allocation

### Removed
- Previous limitation warnings from documentation (no longer applicable)
- Workaround implementation using `GetAuthSessionTicket()` internally

### Technical Details
- Implemented `CCallbackBase` struct with virtual function table (vtable) for Steam callback dispatch
- Used `koffi.register()` to create callback function pointers compatible with Steam's C API
- Callback ID 168 (`k_iSteamUserCallbacks + 68`) for `GetTicketForWebApiResponse_t`
