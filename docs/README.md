# Steamworks FFI Documentation

Complete API documentation for all Steamworks FFI functionality.

## 🎯 Manager-Based API

Steamworks FFI uses a **manager-based architecture** for better organization:

```typescript
import SteamworksSDK from 'steamworks-ffi-node';

const steam = SteamworksSDK.getInstance();
steam.init({ appId: 480 });

// Access features through specialized managers
steam.achievements.*      // Achievement operations
steam.stats.*             // Statistics operations
steam.leaderboards.*      // Leaderboard operations
steam.friends.*           // Friends and social operations
steam.richPresence.*      // Rich Presence operations
steam.overlay.*           // Overlay control operations
steam.cloud.*             // Cloud storage operations
steam.workshop.*          // Workshop/UGC operations
steam.input.*             // Controller input operations
steam.screenshots.*       // Screenshots operations
steam.apps.*              // DLC and app ownership operations
steam.matchmaking.*       // Multiplayer lobby operations
steam.utils.*             // System utilities and device detection
steam.networkingUtils.*   // Ping location and relay network
steam.networkingSockets.* // P2P connections and messaging
steam.user.*              // User authentication, security, and voice
```

This design:

- ✅ **Groups related functions** - Easy to discover all achievement/stats/leaderboard methods
- ✅ **Clear namespacing** - No naming conflicts
- ✅ **Better IDE support** - Autocomplete shows relevant methods
- ✅ **Logical organization** - Matches Steamworks SDK structure

⚠️ **Note:** Matchmaking and Networking Sockets tests require two separate Steam accounts to fully test multiplayer functionality. Run the host test on one machine, then the join test on another machine with a different Steam account.

📁 All tests are in `tests/` folder with separate `js/` and `ts/` subfolders.

💡 **Pro tip**: TypeScript tests import directly from `src/` so you can test changes immediately without running `npm run build`!
